# React Bank

A simple web app wher you can add and remove transactions.

All transactions persist in database and show you in a list page.

## Getting Started

For using this app, you can clone this project to your computer with the command `git clone git@github.com:locemarn/react-bank.git`.

Late, you need run command `npm install` to install all dependencies.

After that, you just can run command `npm start` or if you prefeer using yarn, run command `yarn start`.

Have fun. =)

### Prerequisities

You need to be install in your computer [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/).

I recomend you install ReactJs globally with the command `npm install -g create-react-app`.

## Running the tests

I made simple tests in this app. Then you can run `yarn test` or `npm test` for see all tests applied.

For stop the test, use Ctrl + c on Windows and Linux or Comand + c on Mac.
